# A Fsharp scripting template with the Fuchu test runner and Unquote assertion library

Currently this is linux/mono only.  

### Setup

To install the packages run the ./setup.sh script 

### Usage

To run the tests use fsharp interactive mode in your editor (if you have this setup - i recommend it).  Alternatively use this command:

```
fsharpi tests.fsx
```
